# ðŸš€ Minishell: As Beautiful as a Shell ðŸš€

Welcome to Minishell, a project that will take you back in time to the early days of computing. This project involves creating a simple, interactive shell similar to bash. By building Minishell, you'll gain a deep understanding of processes, file descriptors, and the intricacies of shell functionalities. Let's dive into the details! ðŸŒŸ

## Introduction

The existence of shells is intertwined with the history of IT. Initially, developers communicated with computers using 1/0 switches, which was highly inefficient. The invention of shells allowed for interaction using command lines in human-readable language, revolutionizing computer communication. Minishell will help you understand and recreate the challenges faced during those early days.

### Shell Requirements

- Display a prompt when waiting for a new command.
- Have a working history.
- Search and launch the right executable (based on the PATH variable or using a relative or an absolute path).
- Avoid using more than one global variable to indicate a received signal.
- Handle single (`'`) and double (`"`) quotes.
- Implement redirections:
  - `<` for input redirection.
  - `>` for output redirection.
  - `<<` for heredoc (input until a delimiter is seen).
  - `>>` for output in append mode.
- Implement pipes (`|`).
- Handle environment variables (`$VAR`).
- Handle `$?` to get the exit status of the most recent foreground pipeline.
- Handle `ctrl-C`, `ctrl-D`, and `ctrl-\` like in bash:
  - `ctrl-C` displays a new prompt on a new line.
  - `ctrl-D` exits the shell.
  - `ctrl-\` does nothing.
- Implement the following builtins:
  - `echo` with `-n` option
  - `cd` with relative or absolute path
  - `pwd` with no options
  - `export` with no options
  - `unset` with no options
  - `env` with no options or arguments
  - `exit` with no options

## Bonus Part

Your program must also implement:

- `&&` and `||` with parenthesis for priorities.
- Wildcards `*` should work for the current working directory.

**Note:** The bonus part will only be evaluated if the mandatory part is perfect. This means the mandatory part must be completely functional and meet all requirements.

## Submission and Peer-evaluation

Submit your assignment to your Git repository. Only the work inside your repository will be evaluated during the defense. Double-check the names of your files to ensure correctness. Happy coding! ðŸ˜ƒ
